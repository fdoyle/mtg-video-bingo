to deploy: npm run deploy

Congrats, you found this page! I had my doubts anyone would, but here you are. 

If you're here from github, I'm sorry, this probably isn't especially interesting to you. 

If you're here from youtube, and want to add sets, it's all in /src/data.ts

Happy to accept PR's with new sets. Follow the existing format, and it should just pick up your stuff.

todo: 
get a set for throne of eldraine
improve core-rudy set
(maybe have an "optimistic" board and a "pessimistic" board, for good and bad boxes. that way you're not stuck needing both a good and bad reaction for bingo)

add randomization?
